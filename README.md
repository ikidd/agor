# Agor

**Next-gen agent orchestration for AI-assisted development.**

_The multiplayer, spatial layer that connects Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and any agentic coding tool into one unified workspace._

---

A platform for **real-time, multiplayer agentic development**.
Visualize, coordinate, and automate your AI workflows across tools.
Agor turns every AI session into a composable, inspectable, and reusable building block.

### 🎯 **1. Board View Overview**

**Purpose:** Highlight the session interaction UX.

**Suggested clip:**

- Scroll through a conversation thread between user and agent.
- Expand/collapse message groups, show tool output diffs and permission prompts.
- Hover to reveal **tooltips**, **copy-to-clipboard** buttons, and visual **write diffs**.

## 🚀 What Makes Agor Different

### 🧩 **Agent Orchestration Layer**

- Integrates with **Claude Code**, **Codex**, and soon **Gemini**, via an extensible SDK.
- Centralized **MCP configuration** — connect once, use across all tools.
- Swap or parallelize agents with one command; easily hand off work when one model stalls.

### 🌐 **Multiplayer Spatial Canvas**

- Real-time collaboration with **cursor broadcasting** and **facepiles**.
- Sessions live on a **dynamic board** — cluster by project, phase, or purpose.
- Visualize your full session tree: forks, spawns, subtasks, and outcomes.

### 🧠 **Context-Aware Development**

- Manage deliberate context via `context/` folder of markdown files.
- Dynamically load modular context blocks per session.
- Keep every agent’s worldview focused and version-controlled.

### 🔀 **Native Session Forking & Subtask Forcing**

- **Fork** any session to explore alternative approaches, preserving full ancestry.
- **Spawn** a subtask: Agor automatically creates a new session with a fresh context window.
- Subtasks are introspectable, reusable, and linked in the session genealogy.

### ⚙️ **Zone Triggers — Workflows Made Spatial**

- Define **zones** on your board that trigger templated prompts when sessions are dropped.
- Build **kanban-style flows** or custom pipelines: analyze → develop → review → deploy.
- Combine with context templates to automate arbitrarily complex workflows.

### 🌳 **Git Worktree Management, Simplified**

- Every session maps to an isolated **git worktree** — no branch conflicts.
- Run A/B tests between agents: same repo, different worktrees, different models.
- Track which agent produced which code — a full audit trail between commits and conversations.

### 🕹️ **Real-Time Strategy for AI Teams**

- Coordinate agentic work like a multiplayer RTS.
- Watch teammates or agents move across tasks live.
- Cluster sessions, delegate, pivot, and iterate together.

---

## 💡 What You Can Build

- **Collaborative AI development boards** shared by teams.
- **A/B testing frameworks** comparing agent outputs across tools.
- **Custom “zone-triggered” automation flows**, from idea to deployment.
- **Knowledge maps** of all AI interactions across projects.
- **Cross-agent orchestration** for hybrid Claude–Codex–Gemini workflows.
